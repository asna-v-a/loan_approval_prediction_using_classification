# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict loan approval status using machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using multiple classification techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for interactive UI)

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes
